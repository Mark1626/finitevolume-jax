# JAX Finite Volume Simulation

The jupyter notebook contains a hardware accelerated finite volume simulation made using JAX.

You can read the write up about this in the article I wrote on [Medium](https://medium.com/@nimalan854/building-a-hardware-accelerated-simulation-using-jax-00437d562002)

The code is a port of the python tutorial made by Philip Mocz, https://github.com/pmocz/finitevolume-python/

## Trying this out

Google Collab provides a GPU runtime, you can try this out using [this link](https://colab.research.google.com/github/Mark1626/finitevolume-jax/blob/main/Finite_Volume_Fluid_Simulation_in_JAX.ipynb)
